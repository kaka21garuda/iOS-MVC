 **Task**: Add a `UIView` to the `canvas` that is half as wide and half as high as the `canvas`. This new `UIView` should be _centered_ on the canvas:
 
 ![Challenge 1](./challenge1.png "Challenge 1")

 1. Implement above task by setting the view's `frame` directly.
 2. Implement above task by defining _AutoLayout_ constraints programmatically.
 
 (Make sure to comment out the first implementation once you start working on the second one to avoid confusion.)
